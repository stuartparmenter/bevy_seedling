/// A component that queues sample playback.
///
/// ## Playing sounds
///
/// Playing a sound is very simple!
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_seedling::prelude::*;
/// fn play_sound(mut commands: Commands, server: Res<AssetServer>) {
///     commands.spawn(SamplePlayer::new(server.load("my_sample.wav")));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This queues playback in a [`SamplerPool`][crate::prelude::SamplerPool].
/// When no effects are applied, samples are played in the
/// [`DefaultPool`][crate::prelude::DefaultPool].
///
/// The [`SamplePlayer`] component includes two fields that cannot change during
/// playback: `repeat_mode` and `volume`. Because [`SamplePlayer`] is immutable,
/// these can only be changed by re-inserting, which subsequently stops and restarts
/// playback. To update a sample's volume dynamically, consider adding a
/// [`VolumeNode`][crate::prelude::VolumeNode] as an effect.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// By default, entities with a [`SamplePlayer`] component are despawned when
/// playback completes. If you insert [`SamplePlayer`] components on gameplay entities
/// such as the player or enemies, you'll probably want to set [`PlaybackSettings::on_complete`]
/// to [`OnComplete::Remove`] or even [`OnComplete::Preserve`].
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_seedling::prelude::*;
/// #[derive(Component)]
/// struct Player;
///
/// fn play_sound_on_player(
///     player: Single<Entity, With<Player>>,
///     server: Res<AssetServer>,
///     mut commands: Commands,
/// ) {
///     commands.entity(*player).insert((
///         SamplePlayer::new(server.load("my_sample.wav")),
///         PlaybackSettings::default().remove(),
///     ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Applying effects
///
/// Effects can be applied directly to a sample entity with
/// [`SampleEffects`][crate::prelude::SampleEffects].
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_seedling::prelude::*;
/// fn play_with_effects(mut commands: Commands, server: Res<AssetServer>) {
///     commands.spawn((
///         SamplePlayer::new(server.load("my_sample.wav")),
///         sample_effects![
///             SpatialBasicNode::default(),
///             FastLowpassNode::<2>::from_cutoff_hz(500.0),
///         ],
///     ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, we connect a spatial and low-pass node in series with the sample player.
/// Effects are arranged in the order they're spawned, so the output of the spatial node is
/// connected to the input of the low-pass node.
///
/// When you apply effects to a sample player, the node components are added using the
/// [`SampleEffects`][crate::prelude::SampleEffects] relationships. If you want to access
/// the effects in terms of the sample they're applied to, you can break up your
/// queries and use the [`EffectsQuery`][crate::prelude::EffectsQuery] trait.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_seedling::prelude::*;
/// # fn play_sound(mut commands: Commands, server: Res<AssetServer>) {
/// commands.spawn((
///     // We'll look for sample player entities with the name "dynamic"
///     Name::new("dynamic"),
///     SamplePlayer::new(server.load("my_sample.wav")),
///     sample_effects![VolumeNode::default()],
/// ));
/// # }
///
/// fn update_volume(
///     sample_players: Query<(&Name, &SampleEffects)>,
///     mut volume: Query<&mut VolumeNode>,
/// ) -> Result {
///     for (name, effects) in &sample_players {
///         if name.as_str() == "dynamic" {
///             // Once we've found the target entity, we can get at
///             // its effects with `EffectsQuery`
///             volume.get_effect_mut(effects)?.volume = Volume::Decibels(-6.0);
///         }
///     }
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Applying effects directly to a [`SamplePlayer`] is simple, but it
/// [has some tradeoffs][crate::pool::dynamic#when-to-use-dynamic-pools], so you may
/// find yourself gravitating towards manually defined [`SamplerPool`][crate::prelude::SamplerPool]s as your
/// requirements grow.
///
/// ## Supporting components
///
/// A [`SamplePlayer`] can be spawned with a number of components:
/// - Any component that implements [`PoolLabel`][crate::prelude::PoolLabel]
/// - [`PlaybackSettings`]
/// - [`SamplePriority`]
/// - [`SampleQueueLifetime`]
/// - [`SampleEffects`][crate::prelude::SampleEffects]
///
/// Altogether, that would look like:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_seedling::{prelude::*, sample::SampleQueueLifetime};
/// # fn spatial_pool(mut commands: Commands, server: Res<AssetServer>) {
/// commands.spawn((
///     DefaultPool,
///     SamplePlayer {
///         sample: server.load("my_sample.wav"),
///         repeat_mode: RepeatMode::PlayOnce,
///         volume: Volume::UNITY_GAIN,
///     },
///     PlaybackSettings {
///         play: Notify::new(true),
///         play_from: PlayFrom::BEGINNING,
///         speed: 1.0,
///         on_complete: OnComplete::Despawn,
///     },
///     SamplePriority(0),
///     SampleQueueLifetime(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)),
///     sample_effects![SpatialBasicNode::default()],
/// ));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Once a sample has been queued in a pool, the [`Sampler`][crate::pool::Sampler] component
/// will be inserted, which provides information about the
/// playhead position and playback status.
